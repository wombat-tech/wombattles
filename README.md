# Wombattles

Leaderboards for Wombattles - HTML, JS and CSS

# Deployment

Leaderboards that go live must be deployed to our CDN.

# Accessing during development

Github pages is enabled for this repository so we can access the leaderboards without invalidating caches during
development.

To update the Github pages version make sure all compiled code (like Typescript) is also checked in and then access it
under `https://wombat-tech.github.io/wombattles/$PATH`.
